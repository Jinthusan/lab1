Let's create a function as a variable (function expression) that prints ‘Hello World’ to console and another function which accepts a variable. The argument passed to the second function will be executed as a function inside the body. The second function passes the first function as the argument as follows.

        var x = function(){
            console.log('Hello World')
        }

        var y = function(variable){
            return variable();
        }

        y(x);
